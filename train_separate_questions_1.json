The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

Distributor also represents and warrants that it will undertake commercially reasonable endeavours in good faith to comply with Google's  business partner due diligence process including providing requested information.\n\n  - 9 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n8.2 Google warrants that the Distribution Products will for a period of [ * ] from the date of their supply to Distributor be free from any defect  which has a materially adverse effect on their use or operation.\n\n8.3 If any of the warranties in Clause 8.1 or 8.2 is breached by Google, Distributor must tell Google as soon as possible. Distributor must give  Google a reasonable time to fix the problem and (if necessary) to supply Distributor with a corrected or replacement version of the  Distribution Product or a way to work-around the problem that is not materially detrimental to Distributor, or to re-perform any relevant  services. This will be done without any additional charge to Distributor. If Google is able to do this within a reasonable time, Google will  have no other obligations or liability in relation to that breach.\n\n8.4 Google will not be liable for breach of any of the warranties or other terms in this Agreement to the extent that the breach arises from:\n\n  (a) use of the Products other than in accordance with normal operating procedures;\n\n  (b) any alterations or maintenance to the Products done by anyone other than Google or someone authorised by Google;\n\n  (c) any problem with a computer on which the Products are installed, or with any equipment connected to that computer or any  other software which is installed on that computer;\n\n  (d) any abnormal or incorrect operating conditions; or\n\n  (e) use of the Products in combination with any other hardware or software, unless this use has been approved by Google in  writing.\n\n8.5 Distributor will comply with all applicable commercial and public anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, the UK's Bribery Act  2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"Anti-Bribery Laws\"), which prohibit (amongst other things) corrupt offers of  anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official to obtain or keep business. ''Government officials\" include any  government employee, candidate for public office, and employee of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public  international organisations, and political parties. Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to  induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform.\n\n8.6 No conditions, warranties or other terms apply to the Products, [ * ] or to any other goods or services supplied under this Agreement  unless expressly set out in this Agreement. Subject to Clause 9.1, no implied conditions, warranties or other terms apply (including any  implied terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or conformance with description).\n\n9.

If the amount referred to in (b) above cannot be calculated accurately at the time the relevant liability is to be  assessed (the \"Applicable Time\"), it shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis as X/Y x Z. Where:     X = the total sum paid and payable to the Distributor pursuant to Clause 4 in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time;     Y = the number of days elapsed in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time; and     Z = 365     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (c) breach of any implied condition as to title or quiet enjoyment; and\n\n  (d) misuse of confidential information.\n\n9.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either party's liability under Clause 10 (Indemnities), or Distributor's liability under Clause  2 (License Grants and Restrictions), Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity), Clause 3.6 (End User License Agreement) and Clause 3.7 (Accurate  Reproduction) or Clause [ * ].\n\n9.3 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any:\n\n  (a) loss of anticipated savings;\n\n  (b) loss of business opportunity (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include loss of advertising revenue);\n\n  (c) loss of or corruption of data;\n\n  (d) loss or damage resulting from third party claims; or\n\n  (e) indirect or consequential losses;\n     suffered or incurred by the other party (whether or not such losses were within the contemplation of the parties at the date of this  Agreement).\n\n9.4 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, each party's total liability under or in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or  otherwise) arising in any Contract Year is limited to the greater of:\n\n  (a) [ * ] Euros ([ * ] Euros); and\n\n  (b) [ * ]% of the total payment due to the Distributor in the relevant Contract Year pursuant to Clause 4 (Payment Terms).\n\n  - 11 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   By Distributor.\n\n   User claim arising out of or resulting from such End Users use of any Distributor App(s), including any actions or claims in product  liability, tort, contract or equity.     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.

[ * ] will use reasonable  endeavours to [ * ] with [ * ] (to the extent it is practicable to do so) of the [ * ] or [ * ].\n\n10.4 Distributor [ * ] and will indemnify Google against all liabilities, costs, damages and expenses (including settlement costs approved in  writing by Distributor and reasonable legal fees [ * ]) suffered or incurred by Google or any Google Group Company arising from: (a)  Distributor's improper (ie not in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement including the Exhibits) or unauthorised, replication,  packaging, marketing, distribution, or installation of the Products, including any breach of Clause 8.5 and any claims based on  representations, warranties, or misrepresentations made by Distributor, (b) any claim from a third party that the Distributor App(s)  infringe any third party copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or (c) any End\n\n  - 12 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.5 The indemnification obligations set out in Clause 10.4(b) shall exist only if Google: (a) promptly notifies Distributor of such claim, (b)  provides Distributor with reasonable information, assistance and cooperation in responding to and, where applicable, defending the  lawsuit or proceeding, and (c) gives Distributor full control and sole authority over the defense and settlement of such claim. Google may  join in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense.\n\n10.6 The foregoing Clauses 10.1 to 10.5 states the parties' entire liability and exclusive remedy with respect to infringement of a third party's  Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n11.

Distributor shall ensure that the first launch of the Chrome Browser following installation of the Chrome Browser complies with each of the  following requirements (the \"Chrome Launch Requirements\"):     (a) The Chrome Browser shall auto-launch immediately prior to the launch of the Distributor App, no earlier and no later.     *Confidential treatment requested\n\n\n\n  - 21 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   (b) No advertisements, offers, or other communications shall appear between launch of a Distributor App and launch of the Chrome  Browser.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, each of the following shall appear on the End User's desktop exactly as shown in  this Exhibit B: (i) the location and size of the Chrome Browser window and the Distributor App window, (ii) the z-order of the Distributor App and  the Chrome Browser, and (iii) the number and content of the tabs in the Chrome Browser (i.e., the Chrome Browser shall contain exactly two (2)  tabs, with the first tab set to google.com, and the second tab set to http://tools.google.com/chrome/intlfen-US/welcome.html (or such other url as  Google may specify). In no event shall the Chrome Browser window be minimized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may modify the  content and design of the Distributor App window provided that Distributor complies with the other restrictions in this Agreement and obtains  Google's prior consent.     (d) The tabs in the Chrome Browser and the Omnibox shall be clearly visible to the End User as shown in this Exhibit B, regardless of the  resolution of the End User's monitor. In no event shall the tabs in the Chrome Browser or the Omnibox be hidden behind a Distributor App.     (e) Distributor shall implement (or, if implemented by Google, Distributor shall not modify) the six-month flag (i.e., the functionality that  prevents an End User from receiving more than one (1) offer for the Chrome Browser within any six (6)-month period) unless Google has provided  written confirmation (including by email) that the 6-months flag can be turned off. Note that this authorisation may be revoked at any time and  Distributor shall then include the 6 months flag again in future builds.\n\n\n\n  - 22 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  EXHIBIT C     Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications     Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying  practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.    Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 23 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as  appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these  Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.     If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 24 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   1. General.     1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to \"hacking\" or \"cracking.\"     3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise  annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user's computer system for any purpose not understood and  affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or  computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer  or obtaining personal information from an end user's computer such as login, password, account or other information  personal to the end user);\n\n  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers;\n\n  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with  an end user's Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer;\n\n  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously  declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or  configuration);\n\n  - 25 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4. Disclosure and Consent.     4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your  distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines)  design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no  \"drive-by' downloads or installs. By \"distribution partner\" we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by \"bundling partner\"  we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance  with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google  Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2)  collects or transmits information related to a user's computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user's  personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission  you:\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an  alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end  user that you and your Application are the source of that page);\n\n  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change  his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or\n\n  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users:\n\n  (i) that they are installing an application,\n\n  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and\n\n  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to install the Application.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose:\n\n  - 26 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a  change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the  browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application),  unless prior to making such change you:\n\n\n\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that  have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu,  and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the  end user.     4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information),\n\n  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and\n\n  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the  information; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of  such change; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to make such change.\n\n  - 27 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these  Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation;\n\n  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these  Guidelines;\n\n  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising  displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is  conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user's computer, the end  user must be made aware of that relationship; and\n\n  - 28 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with \"golden masters\" of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google's written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided,  however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days' written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the  date on which you receive such notice, the \"Update Notice Date\"), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30)  days     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in  the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application  may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle.\n\n  - 29 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies  with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of  such update (the \"Update Effective Date\"), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any  event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the  Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your  confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the \"Maximum Compliance Period\"). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.   27\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and not joint.\n\n(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.\n\n7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents. A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a   28\n\n\n\n\n\nletter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a \"New Remarketing Agent\") in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree as set forth in Annex V to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacities, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\n11. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate (i) in the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing or (ii) as to any Remarketing Agent who resigns or is removed, on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the   29\n\n\n\n\n\nobligations of the Remarketing Agents may be terminated by them by notice given to the Company prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the Remarketing Settlement Date if, prior to that time, any of the applicable conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur.\n\n12. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 11 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, the former Remarketing Agents shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of the Remarketing Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Remarketing Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.\n\n13.

Counterparts. This Remarketing Agreement and the Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.\n\n19.

Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable. If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor's and/or Franchisee's legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid. 5. Delay. No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 6.

Without limiting the terms set forth in Section 6.09 of the Separation Agreement, none of Nuance, SpinCo or any other member of either Group shall in any event have any Liability to the other or to any other member of the other's Group under this Agreement for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages, whether or not caused by or resulting from negligence or breach of obligations hereunder and whether or not informed of the possibility of the existence of such damages.\n\nSection 7.02. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. Each of Nuance (on behalf of itself and each other member of the Nuance Group) and SpinCo (on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group) understands and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no Party is representing or warranting in any way, including any 11\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nimplied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, registerability, allowability, enforceability or non-infringement, as to any Intellectual Property Rights licensed hereunder, as to the sufficiency of the Intellectual Property Rights licensed hereunder for the conduct and operations of the SpinCo Business or the Nuance Business, as applicable, as to the value or freedom from any Security Interests of, or any other matter concerning, any Intellectual Property Rights licensed hereunder, or as to the absence of any defenses or rights of setoff or freedom from counterclaim with respect to any claim or other Intellectual Property Rights of any such Party, or as to the legal sufficiency of any assignment, document or instrument delivered hereunder to convey title to any Intellectual Property Rights or thing of value upon the execution, delivery and filing hereof or thereof. Except as may expressly be set forth herein, any such Intellectual Property Rights are being licensed on an \"as is,\" \"where is\" basis and the respective licensees shall bear the economic and legal risks related to the use of the Nuance IP in the SpinCo Business or the SpinCo IP in the Nuance Business, as applicable.\n\nARTICLE VIII TRANSFERABILITY AND ASSIGNMENT\n\nSection 8.01. No Assignment or Transfer Without Consent. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party's assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party's assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party's Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.\n\nSection 8.02. Divested Businesses. In the event a Party divests a line of business or line of products or services by (a) spinning off a member of its Group by its sale or other disposition to a Third Party, (b) reducing ownership or control in a member of its Group so that it no longer qualifiers as a member of its Group under this Agreement, (c) selling or otherwise transferring such line of business, products or services to a Third Party or (d) forming a joint venture with a Third Party with respect to such line of business, products or services (each such divested entity or line of business, products or services, a \"Divested Entity\"), the Divested Entity 12\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nshall retain those licenses granted to it under this Agreement, provided that the license shall be limited to the business, products or services (as applicable) of the Divested Entity as of the date of divestment and such natural development thereof within the Nuance Field of Use (where Nuance is the divesting Party) or SpinCo Field of Use (where SpinCo is the divesting party). The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity's and, in the event it is acquired by a Third Party, such Third Party's execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event will the licenses retained by a Divested Entity extend to products, services or other activities of a Third Party acquirer existing on or before the date of the divestment, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such divestment, and (ii) in the event that a Divested Entity owns any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to the other Party under this Agreement, such Intellectual Property Rights may be transferred or assignment with such Divested Entity subject to the terms and conditions this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE IX TERMINATION\n\nSection 9.01. Termination by Both Parties. Subject to Section 9.02, this Agreement may not be terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties.\n\nSection 9.02. Termination prior to the Distribution. This Agreement may be terminated by Nuance at any time, in its sole discretion, prior to the Distribution; provided, however, that this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Separation Agreement in accordance with its terms.\n\nSection 9.03. Effect of Termination; Survival. In the event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the Distribution, neither Party (nor any member of their Group or any of their respective directors or officers) shall have any Liability or further obligation to the other Party or any member of its Group under this Agreement. Except with respect to termination of the Agreement under Section 9.02, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, ARTICLE I, ARTICLE VI, ARTICLE VII, this Section 9.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE X FURTHER ASSURANCES\n\nSection 10.01. Further Assurances.\n\n(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements to consummate, and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each Party shall cooperate with the other Party, without any further 13\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nconsideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party: (i) to execute and deliver, or use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including any instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer as such Party may reasonably be requested to execute and deliver by the other Party; (ii) to make, or cause to be made, all filings with, and to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all Consents of any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, Contract, indenture or other instrument; and (iii) to take, or cause to be taken, all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take by the other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and any transfers of Intellectual Property Rights or assignments and assumptions of Liabilities related thereto as set forth in the Separation Agreement.\n\nARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS\n\nSection 11.01. Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Corporate Power.\n\n(a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which counterparts shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the other Party. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or PDF signature and scanned and exchanged by electronic mail, and such facsimile or PDF signature or scanned and exchanged copies shall constitute an original for all purposes.\n\n(b) This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous agreements, negotiations, discussions, writings, understandings, commitments and conversations with respect to such subject matter, and there are no agreements or understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof other than those set forth or referred to herein or therein. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n(c) Nuance represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the Nuance Group, and SpinCo represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group, as follows:\n\n(i) each such Person has the requisite corporate or other power and authority and has taken all corporate or other action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and\n\n(ii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes, or will constitute, a valid and binding agreement of it enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof.\n\nSection 11.02. Dispute Resolution.

If any such alleged breach is not so resolved, then a senior executive of each Party shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such alleged breach within the following thirty (30) days of the referral of the matter to the senior executives. If no resolution is reached with respect to any such alleged breach in accordance with the procedures contained in this Section 11.02, then the Parties may seek to resolve such matter in accordance with Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06\n\nSection 11.03. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. Any disputes relating to, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including to its execution, performance, or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.\n\nSection 11.04.

In accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, at any time after giving notice of a Dispute, each Party shall be entitled to interim measures of protection duly granted by a court of competent jurisdiction: (1) to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the Dispute; (2) to prevent the destruction or loss of documents and other information or things relating to the Dispute; or (3) to prevent the transfer, disposition or hiding of assets. Any such interim measure (or a request therefor to a court of competent jurisdiction) shall not be deemed incompatible with the provisions of Section 11.02, Section 11.03 and Section 11.04. Until such Dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 11.02 or final judgment is rendered in accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, each 15\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nParty agrees that such Party shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that such obligations shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination.\n\nSection 11.06.

The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy are waived.\n\nSection 11.07. Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or as otherwise may be provided in the Separation Agreement with respect to the rights of any Nuance Indemnitee or SpinCo Indemnitee, in his, her or its respective capacities as such, (a) the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Parties hereto and are not intended to confer upon any Person except the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder and (b) there are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and this Agreement shall not provide any third person with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.08.

The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Nuance and the members of the Nuance Group and SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group, as licensees of such intellectual property rights under this Agreement, shall retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code (including Nuance's and the Nuance Group members' and SpinCo's and the SpinCo Group members' right 17\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nto the continued enjoyment of the rights and licenses respectively granted by under this Agreement).\n\nSection 11.11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances, or in jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision.\n\nSection 11.12. Expenses. Except as set forth on Schedule XXIV to the Separation Agreement, as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, (i) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off prior to or on the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any financing fees or interest payable in respect of any indebtedness incurred by SpinCo in connection with the Spin-Off), will be borne and paid by Nuance and (ii) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off following the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date, will be borne and paid by the Party incurring such fee, cost or expense. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.12 shall not affect each Party's responsibility to indemnify Nuance Liabilities or SpinCo Liabilities, as applicable, arising from the transactions contemplated by the Distribution.\n\nSection 11.13. Headings. The article, section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement, including in the table of contents of this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.14.

Waivers of Default. No failure or delay of any Party (or the applicable member of its Group) in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Waiver by any Party of any default by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default.\n\nSection 11.16. Amendments. No provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, amended, supplemented or modified by any Party, unless such waiver, amendment, 18\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplement or modification is in writing and signed by the authorized representative of each Party.\n\nSection 11.17.
